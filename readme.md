Imports sermons into Sermon Manager using ID3 information.

## Description

Imports sermons into [Sermon Manager for Wordpress](https://bitbucket.org/wpforchurch/sermon-manager-for-wordpress) using ID3 information. Only MP3 files are currently supported. Files can either be uploaded via the WordPress uploader or through another method. The plugin adds files to the `wp-content/uploads/sermon-manager-import` folder by default. A different folder can be specified in the options. The plugin only searches the base folder specified! Files added through the WordPress uploader will show up in the media library as unattached. The files are then attached to the sermon when imported. 

When the sermon is posted, the file is moved to the uploads folder using the organization method selected in the WordPress settings. Sermons can be posted in the `publish` or `draft` status.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory via FTP or `git clone https://github.com/khornberg/sermon-manager-import` in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is ID3?
[ID3](http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/ID3) is metadata for most MP3 files. When you use a media player (e.g. iTunes, Windows Media Player, etc.) the title, artist, etc. is stored within each file in the ID3 format.

### I get a `Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded`
Likely you are importing a lot of sermons. Refresh the page and import all of the remaining sermons again. Repeat as necessary if that doesn't do it. Your server is set to run a process for limited time. When importing many sermons, you reach this limit and the server lets you know.

### Does this work with Amazon S3 or other serivces?
Not sure. Please let me know.

### Can I help?
Sure can. See the Contributing section below.

### **WARNINGS**
* All uploads identified as `audio/mp3` (usually only MP3 files) are uploaded to the import folder specified. All other files will be uploaded to the normal upload directory.  
* When posting a file that is an unattached entry, the unattached entry will be deleted. Normally, this is not an issue and is only a temporary entry. However, if you manually attached the uploaded media to a post, it will not work after importing the sermon. This is an unlikely scenario.  
* This plugin does not have the ability to add media already in the WordPress media library to sermon manager. To do this, one would manually (ssh, ftp, etc) move the files to the specified import folder. Then continue as normal. This method will delete the previous entry in the media library. If you have the media attached to another post, the old post will not work.
